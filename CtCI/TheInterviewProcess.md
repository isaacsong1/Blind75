# The Interview Process

Think of technical questions as problem-solving questions (45 minutes)

Do your best to talk out loud and explain your thought process (interviewer might jump in to help). Does not mean it is going poorly.

Assessment of your performance breakdown:
- ANALYTICAL SKILLS :  
    Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take to get a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- CODING SKILLS : 
    Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE / COMPTUER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS :
    Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- EXPERIENCE :
    Have you made good technical decisions in the past? have you build interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- CULTURE FIT / COMMUNICATION SKILLS :
    Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

Standard algorithm questions may be based on the first three.


Why things are like this :
    Each complaint about the process comes with a valid reasoning.
- False negatives are acceptable:
    Interviewers are far more concerned with false positives: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.
- Problem-solving skills are valuable:
    If you get through a several hard problems, you are probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms.
- Basis data structure and algoithm knowledge is useful:
    In the chances that trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and other knowledge comes up, it is valuable to know beforehand. It is hard to use a binary search tree if you don't know what it is. If you do know, then you pretty much know the basics.
