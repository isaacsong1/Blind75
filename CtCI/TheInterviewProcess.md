# The Interview Process

Think of technical questions as problem-solving questions (45 minutes)

Do your best to talk out loud and explain your thought process (interviewer might jump in to help). Does not mean it is going poorly.

Assessment of your performance breakdown:
- ANALYTICAL Skills :  
    Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take to get a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- CODING Skills : 
    Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE / Computer Science Fundamentals :
    Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- EXPERIENCE :
    Have you made good technical decisions in the past? have you build interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
