# The Interview Process

Think of technical questions as problem-solving questions (45 minutes)

Do your best to talk out loud and explain your thought process (interviewer might jump in to help). Does not mean it is going poorly.

Assessment of your performance breakdown:
- ANALYTICAL SKILLS :  
    Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take to get a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- CODING SKILLS : 
    Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE / COMPTUER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS :
    Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- EXPERIENCE :
    Have you made good technical decisions in the past? have you build interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- CULTURE FIT / COMMUNICATION SKILLS :
    Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

Standard algorithm questions may be based on the first three.


Why things are like this :
    Each complaint about the process comes with a valid reasoning.
- False negatives are acceptable:
    Interviewers are far more concerned with false positives: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.
- Problem-solving skills are valuable:
    If you get through a several hard problems, you are probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms.
- Basis data structure and algoithm knowledge is useful:
    In the chances that trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and other knowledge comes up, it is valuable to know beforehand. It is hard to use a binary search tree if you don't know what it is. If you do know, then you pretty much know the basics.

Whiteboards let you focus on what matters:
- The interviewer does not expect perfect code on a whiteboard. Virtually everyone has some bugs or minor syntactical errors
- Whiteboard allows you to focus on the big picture. You don't need to compile or write the entire class definition and boilerplate code. Instead, the focus is on the 'meaty' parts of the code, the function that the question is really all about
- Whiteboards help the candidate speak more and explain their thought process. Computers cause communication to drop substantially.

How questions are selected:
- Some companies focus on algoithms (often with some system design worked in) and othewrs really like knowledge-based questions

Evaluation process:
- Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviewer
- Your interviewer develops a feel  for your performance by comparing you to other people. This is relative to ALL the candidates that the interviewer has asked the question to
- For this reason, getting ah ard question is not a bad thing. When it is harder for you, it is harder for everyone

FAQ:
I didn't hear back immediately after my interview. Am I being rejected?
- No, there could he a number of reasons why the decision is delayed. Simply, interviewer has not provided feedback yet. If you don't hear back from a company within 3-5 business days after your interview, check in (politely) with your recruiter
